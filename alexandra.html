        <p>Sunflowers, with their bold golden petals and towering stems, are often seen as a symbol of warmth, positivity, and resilience. Their bright faces follow the path of the sun across the sky, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. Beyond their beauty, sunflowers are remarkably versatile—providing seeds rich in nutrients, oil for cooking, and even contributing to environmental sustainability by helping clean contaminated soil. Standing tall in fields that seem to glow under the summer sun, they embody optimism and strength, reminding us to keep reaching upward toward light and growth.</p>
